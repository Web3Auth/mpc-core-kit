> Web3Auth is where passwordless auth meets non-custodial key infrastructure for Web3 apps and wallets. By aggregating OAuth (Google, Twitter, Discord) logins, different wallets and innovative Multi Party Computation (MPC) - Web3Auth provides a seamless login experience to every user on your application.

Web3Auth MPC Core Kit Beta is a wrapper SDK that gives you all the needed functionalities for implementing the Web3Auth MPC features, giving you the flexibility of implementing your own UI and UX flows end to end.

### Get your Client ID from Web3Auth Dashboard

Hop on to the [Web3Auth Dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io/) and create a new project. Use the Client ID of the project to start your integration.

### Initialize Web3Auth for your preferred blockchain

Web3Auth needs to initialise as soon as your app loads up to enable the user to log in. Preferably done within a constructor, initialisation is the step where you can pass on all the configurations for Web3Auth you want. A simple integration for Ethereum blockchain will look like this:

```js
import { Web3AuthMPCCoreKit } from "@web3auth/mpc-core-kit";

//Initialize within your constructor
const web3auth = new Web3AuthMPCCoreKit({
    web3AuthClientId: 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID',
    web3AuthNetwork: WEB3AUTH_NETWORK.DEVNET
});


await web3auth.init();
```

### Login your User

Once you're done initialising, just create a button that triggers login for your preferred social channel for the user on their request. You can further use the returned provider for making RPC calls to the blockchain.

```js
const web3authProvider = await web3auth.connect({ 
    subVerifierDetails: { 
        verifier: "torus-test-health",
        typeOfLogin: 'jwt',
        clientId: "torus-key-test",
        jwtParams: {
            verifierIdField: "email",
            id_token: token
        }
    }
})
```
